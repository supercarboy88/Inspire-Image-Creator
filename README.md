## Overview
Have you ever seen those pesky images on your social media that try to make you smile? Have they failed? Do you think you can do better? Welcome to our Content Generator. Add any phrase, quote, pretty much any text to an image you want, and share it with the social-media world. Want to risk it all to chance? Use our randomizer and we’ll add a random phrase or quote to a random gif or photo and see if it makes your day. You can also keep clicking on the Search button until you get the image you want.

## Primary Goals
Add text to an image file, and create a new image file.
Share the new URL with the combined image file to your twitter account
## Specifications
We plan on using social media plugins to share the URL containing the image file and we want to use Lorem Picsum to grab our image file from. This isn’t a new concept, but we do plan on making our website easy to use and attractive enough so that it brings in online traffic. 

## Target Audience
Mainly pre-teens and Young adults 
## Problem & how to address it 
Allows users to create their own content easily and quickly without having to pay for photo editing software or dealing with editing apps.

## Use Case
a user visits the website to create an image file:
- user searches for an image they're interested in
- user then selects an image and a quote they want to combine to create one image
- once the image file is created, it will get it's own url that will be used with the social media pugins
- user will post their image file to their Twitter account!

## Next Steps
- use Node.js to allow for the combined image to get it's own URL and be shared to one's twitter account
- fix the bug that hides extra social media plugins so that there's more choses of where to share the URL.
- We can also go with our original idea of getting a gif file instead of a static image to create one combined gif file with the text overlayed on top of it.
